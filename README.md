# Overview of Analysis

  - The purpose of this analysis is to build a model in order to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers.
  - The financial information the data is based on is from historical lending activity from a peer to peer lending services company.
  - The dependent variable used in this model (y_value) was the 'loan_status' which indicated if the loan is healthy or at risk.
  - The independent variables used in this model (x_values) were the 'loan_size', 'interest_rate', 'borrower_income', 'debt_to_income_ratio', 'number_of_accounts', and 'derogatory_marks'.
